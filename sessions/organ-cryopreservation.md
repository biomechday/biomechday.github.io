# Challenges during Organ Preservation

{% capture text %}


Learn about current organ preservation methods, their limitations and challenges during whole organ cryopreservation. Demonstrate the deformation of CPA during cooling and fracturing due to high thermal stress during vitrification using scanning cryomacroscope. Briefly describe the mathematical modeling to understand the effects during cryopreservation.
