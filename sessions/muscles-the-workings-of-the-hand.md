# Muscles: The Working of the Hand

{% capture text %}


Our hands are very useful tools that separate us from many of our ancestors in the animal kingdom. While most of us take them for granted, our hands are one of the most intricate parts of our body and this is mostly due to the muscles in our hands. Here we will study and test how the muscles in our hands work and how they can fail. We will have fun experiments for you to try out!
