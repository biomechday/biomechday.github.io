Millions of people around the world, especially in developing countries, donâ€™t have access to affordable prosthetic devices. Recent advances in low-cost 3D printing technologies have enabled clinicians to create custom 3D printed prosthetics for their patients! Join our session to learn more about the exciting and impactful world of 3D printed prosthetics from a leader in the field, Jerry Evans! This session is a pre-recorded interview with Jerry, the President and CEO of Nia Technologies. Nia Technologies is a Canadian non-profit that, among other things, has developed and deployed 3D printing technology in Canada, Tanzania Uganda, and Cambodia.

In this interview, you will learn about:

- How 3D scanning + 3D printing is used for low-cost prosthetic devices
- Challenges of creating prosthetic devices in the developing world
