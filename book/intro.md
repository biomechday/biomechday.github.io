# Welcome to our public repository of scientific lessions!

National Biomechanics Day at CMU is a student-led organization, aiming to provide scientific outreach opportunities and tools for a broad community. On this site you can access several lessions we have offered in the past, related to biomechanics. These lessions are appropriate for a general K-12 audience, but is better suited for students grades 7 and above.  

The contents of this repository is structured by the broad category that lessons fit into, such as:

1. Robotics
2. Cardiovascular system
3. Skeletal system
4. Human locomotion
5. Cell mechanics

Within each category, there can be several lessons. In each lesson, we provide include all the resources required to teach the content and reproduce any devices/learning tools involved. This includes 3D printed CAD files, code/software, as well as a list of materials to purchase. Our goal is to ensure that teaching materials are low-cost and accessible.
