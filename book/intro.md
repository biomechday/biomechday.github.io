National Biomechanics Day at CMU is a student-led organization, aiming to provide scientific outreach opportunities and tools for a broad community. On this site you can access several lessions we have offered in the past, related to biomechanics. These lessions are appropriate for a general K-12 audience, but is better suited for students grades 7 and above.
