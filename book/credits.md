We anticipate that the content of this book will change significantly. Therefore, we recommend using the source code directly with the citation above that refers to the GitHub repository and lists the date and name of the file. Although content will be added over time, chapter titles and URL's in this book are expected to remain relatively static. However, we make no guarantee, so if it is important for you to reference a specific location/commit within the book.

## How the book is made
This website is written in markdown and jupyter notebooks files, which are converted to html using tools from [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.io/). The files are stored on a [public GitHub repository](`https://biomechday.github.io/`). The website can be viewed at `https://github.com/biomechday/biomechday.github.io`.

To recreate the website you have two options (more information in the [TeachBooks manual](https://teachbooks.io/manual/):
- In the GitHub interface: fork this repository, enable Github Pages from the source GitHub actions (Settings - Code and automation - Pages - Build and deployment - Source - GitHub Actions), enable workflows (Actions - I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them) and run the call-deploy-book workflow (Actions - call-deploy-book - Run workflow - Run workflow). The website is released on the URL as shown on the workflow summary when the workflow has finished (Actions - call-deploy-book - call-deploy-book - Summary).
- On your own computer: clone this repository, install the required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and build the book (`teachbooks build book`). The website is stored locally in `book/_build/index.html`.
