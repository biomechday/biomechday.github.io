## Lesson Overview
This lesson covers topics in medical imaging methods, with a focus on cardiovascular applications. Specifically, it focuses on X-Ray, CT, ultrasound, and MRI. After a brief powerpoint lesson, an interactive computer session is followed in which students an open-source software to build models of blood vessels using MRI images.


It starts with a 15-20 minute powerpoint lesson that covers the aforementioned topics, followed by a guided exercise to build 3D computer models of the descending aorta and iliac arteries. It is the instructor's responsibility to guide the students through this process. 

The computer exercise requires access to Windows or Mac computers, ideally with windows 10 software or newer. A free, open source software called **SimVascular** is required for the exercise. The exercise files are linked on this page.
